# Creating a Fiscal Host

{% hint style="danger" %}
With the implementation of the new [Dashboard interface](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/product/understanding-your-dashboard), we are currently in the process of updating our documentation and some pages may be out of date. Thank you for your patience. Please [contact](https://opencollective.com/contact) our support team if you need any assistance.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you don't have an account yet, please [create one](https://opencollective.com/create-account). You need an individual account to be able to create a Fiscal Host â€” so fill the form with the info of the **individual** **administrator** of that Fiscal Host.

### Create an Organization

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

Open your user menu and click on the **+** (plus symbol) next to the **My Organizations** section.

![User menu with the + button highlighted in red.](../.gitbook/assets/fiscal-host\_create-a-fiscal-host\_create-organization\_2020-09-27.png)

Give it a **name**, a **short description**, add its **website** address and a few **tags**.

You will then have access to all Fiscal host settings, such as whether you want to be open to applications from Collectives, your host fee, etc.

Don't forget to go to **Receiving Money** and activate a method for people to give money to your Collectives, either credit cards (via Stripe) and/or bank transfers.
