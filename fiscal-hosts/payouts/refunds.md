# Refunds

Collective admins are able to approve refunds for up to 30 days from the date the donation was made, as long as the payment provider supports the transaction.\
\
After that point, donations can only be refunded by Fiscal Host admins.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are not the admin, contact your fiscal host (or [Open Collective support](https://opencollective.com/contact) if your host is managed by Open Collective).
{% endhint %}
