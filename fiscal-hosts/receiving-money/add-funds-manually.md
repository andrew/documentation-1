With the implementation of the new [Dashboard interface](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/product/understanding-your-dashboard), we are currently in the process of updating our documentation and some pages may be out of date. Thank you for your patience. Please [contact](https://opencollective.com/contact) our support team if you need any assistance.

You can manually add funds to a Collective directly. This is useful when you receive a contribution for a Collective outside the Open Collective system (like a bank transfer) and want to apply it to a Collective's budget, or to represent money you're already holding on the platform.

Log in and go to your [Fiscal Host dashboard](../fiscal-host-dashboard/). Click on the **Hosted Collectives** tab.

Use the search bar to find the Collective you want to add funds for.

And fill the form with all required information to add the funds to that Collective with the following information:\

* The source of the funds, and the tier to which the donation applies (if any)
* The **amount** of funds you want to send to a Collective.
* Your **host fee**, which is the fee you charge your Collectives. It's already set to your default, but you can change it to a one-time fee of your preference.
* A short **description** of those funds.
* An **internal memo** used by other host administrators.
* The date the funds were accepted.
* The **source** of those funds. It can be your Fiscal Host, another Collective, or an Organization.

Once you're done, just click on **Add Funds**.

### Internal Memos

Internal memos are used to indicate, to yourself and other administrators, anything of note regarding this transaction. Typically, this will be some information about the source, the provision of funds, or any stipulations under which the funds were provided. For instance:\


* A purchase order or invoice number
* A check number or bank transaction identifier
* A grant application and associated award

The emmo will appear to any administrator under 'view details on the transaction list:\
