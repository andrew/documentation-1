# Add Funds Manually

You can manually add funds to a Collective directly. This is useful when you receive a contribution for a Collective outside the Open Collective system (like a bank transfer) and want to apply it to a Collective's budget, or to represent money you're already holding on the platform.

Navigate to your Dashboard > Collectives.&#x20;

Locate the Collective you'd like to add funds to. Click on the three dots and then the **Add Funds** button.

* The **source** of those funds. It can be your Fiscal Host, another Collective, or an Organization. &#x20;
* The Collective's tier to which the donation applies (if any)
* A short **description** of those funds.
* The **effective date** of which the funds cleared your bank account.&#x20;
* The **Accounting Category** to categorise your accounts
* An **internal memo** used by other host administrators.
* The **amount** of funds you want to send to a Collective.
* Your **host fee**, which is the fee you charge your Collectives. It's already set to your default, but you can change it to a one-time fee of your preference.
* Any **payment processor fees** that need to be included.&#x20;

Once you're done, click **Add Funds**.

* A purchase order or invoice number
* A check number or bank transaction identifier
* A grant application and associated award

The emmo will appear to any administrator under 'view details on the transaction list:\
