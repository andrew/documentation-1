# Bank Transfers

## Bank Transfers

Hosts can receive money directly from their bank account (via bank transfer) and then allocate those funds to a given collective via the dashboard.

Financial Contributors are able to choose 'Bank Transfer' as a payment method:

The instructions for the wire transfer are sent to them via email with a unique transaction identifier. Once the money has been received in the Host's bank account, and admin of the Host will be able to mark the transaction as received in the Host Dashboard and the funds will be added to the collective's budget.&#x20;

To set up this option, please go to your fiscal host  settings and look under receiving money.
