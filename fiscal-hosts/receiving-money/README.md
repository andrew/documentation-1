# Receiving Money

Once you connect Stripe and/or Paypal, financial contributors can select these payment methods when paying your Collectives, and Open Collective will automatically process the transactions and credit the appropriate budget on the platform.

You can also set up [bank transfer payments](bank-transfers.md). If users select this option, they will automatically be given instructions you define to complete their transaction. When the funds arrive, you confirm on the financial contributions section of the dashboard.

You can receive funds by any other means (such as checks or other payments services) and [add them manually](add-funds-manually.md).
