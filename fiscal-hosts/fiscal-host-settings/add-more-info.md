#### **Edit your Fiscal Host Display Name**&#x20;

The display name is used whenever we refer to your profile publicly (your profile page, your comments, your contributions, etc). Anyone can see this name.

#### **Edit your Legal Name**&#x20;

The legal name is private and shared with the hosts for donation receipts, tax forms and when you submit an expense. This name is not displayed publicly and it must be your legal name.
