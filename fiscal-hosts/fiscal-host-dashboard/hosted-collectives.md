## Additional security measures&#x20;

As an added security measure/compliance option for fiscal hosts, their Admins can now freeze or un host a collective- this may be useful for compliance reasons, violations of terms, or if a collective wants to leave but hasn’t removed the fiscal host themselves already.

### **Freezing a Collective**&#x20;

Freezing a Collective means temporarily limiting what a collective (and their connected Projects & Events) can and cannot do on the platform.&#x20;

Freezing a Collective will block all financial activity within that Collective. They will not be able to accept funds, pay out expenses, post updates, create new Events or Projects, or add new Team members under this collective. However, they will still continue to receive recurring donations that were started before this freeze.&#x20;

Contributions and expenses will be removed from the Collective's public profile, and admins will be informed of why the action was taken.&#x20;

### Unhosting a Collective&#x20;

We've also added the ability to un-host a collective, which can be used to free a Collective to choose another host or to become an [independent collective](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/independent-collectives/about-independent-collectives).&#x20;

* This Fiscal Host will no longer manage money on behalf of the Collective.
* Any active recurring PayPal contributions or Virtual Cards will be cancelled.
* Unhosted collectives can then apply to a different fiscal host or become an [Independent Collective](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/independent-collectives/about-independent-collectives).
* Valid Stripe configurations (either through the Fiscal Host or via an IC) by the time we trigger the recurring contributions (beginning of the month) will be properly charged.
* Stripe recurring contributions are charged are able to be transferred to a new host. If the collective has a new host, they continue as usual. If they don't, the contribution will be cancelled.

Before un-hosting, a Collective's [balance must be zeroed](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/collective-settings/zero-collective-balance) by paying expenses, making contributions to other Collectives or gifting the balance to the host.

#### Steps to un host a Collective (if they want to join another Fiscal Host)

1. The collective will make a one-time donation to their new fiscal host in the amount of the balance.
   1. Make sure _"The payee is covering the fees"_ is checked when paying the Expense so the Collective can empty the balance precisely to the cent.
2. The collective admin will need to update the collective's status on the platform to ‘un-host’ it from their current Fiscal Host.
3. The collective admin will need to apply to the new Fiscal Host.
4. The new Fiscal Host will add them to their hosted collectives and reallocate the balance via ‘add funds’ to the collective.
