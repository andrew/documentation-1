The transaction report for Fiscal Hosts that summarizes ledger activity for a given period of time (eg: month, quarter) and “explains” everything that happens in the ledger.

Each line in the report is based on a set of underlying transactions from the selected period. All the transactions in the selected time period are represented in the report and each transactions is only counted once. The report is therefore an accurate summary of all the transactions in the ledger.\

The report is divided into two parts:

* Managed funds represents transactions that occur for the collectives you host (this accounts for funds you hold on behalf of your hosted collectives).
* Operational funds represents transactions that occur for you as a fiscal host (this accounts for your organizational funds as they are represented on the platform).
