# Creating a Collective

{% hint style="danger" %}
With the implementation of the new [Dashboard interface](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/product/understanding-your-dashboard), we are currently in the process of updating our documentation and some pages may be out of date. Thank you for your patience. Please [contact](https://opencollective.com/contact) our support team if you need any assistance.

Open Collective allows you to create a transparent funding page for your project in just a few clicks. No need to incorporate, hire a lawyer and accountant, or define organizational roles!

Once you've registered on Open Collective, reveal the dropdown menu by clicking on your username, then click on the **+ New** button under the **My Collectives** section.

Then, select the category that best describes your Collective.

If you are not creating an [open-source Collective,](https://www.oscollective.org/) you will be immediately directed to a Collective creation form, where you will be asked for your **Collective name**, **URL slug** of choice, and a **brief description** of your Collective's activities.&#x20;

If you are creating a Collective for an **open-source project**, you will be directed to a verification process to join the [Open Source Collective](https://www.oscollective.org/) fiscal host. [More info about that here](osc-verification/).
