# Custom Email

{% hint style="danger" %}
With the implementation of the new [Dashboard interface](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/product/understanding-your-dashboard), we are currently in the process of updating our documentation and some pages may be out of date. Thank you for your patience. Please [contact](https://opencollective.com/contact) our support team if you need any assistance.

You can now add custom text to the automatic email people receive thanking them for their contribution, at the level of a whole Collective and/or a specific Event or Project.&#x20;
