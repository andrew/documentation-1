# Updates & Comms

A lot of Collectives like to periodically update their Financial Contributors, to let them know what their donations are enabling, express thanks, or notify everyone of a change.&#x20;

Similarly, hosts often need to contact the administrators of the Collectives they are hosting.

To create an Update, go to your Dashboard, navigate to the **Updates** section and click on **Create Update**. Updates will appear in the Connect section of your public Collective page and you have the option to also notify your collective admins and/or contributors via email.&#x20;

We offer a rich editor to write your updates! Each update requires a Title and content for the Message. You can also write and publish exclusive updates for your Contributors by changing the **Update Type** to  **Restricted**.
