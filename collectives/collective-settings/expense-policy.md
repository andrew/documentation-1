# Expense Policy

{% hint style="danger" %}
With the implementation of the new [Dashboard interface](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/product/understanding-your-dashboard), we are currently in the process of updating our documentation and some pages may be out of date. Thank you for your patience. Please [contact](https://opencollective.com/contact) our support team if you need any assistance.
{% endhint %}

You can specify an expense policy, which appears on the right of the submit expense form, to give guidance to expense submitters. Making it clear what expenses will be approved and what submitters need to do will save time for you and them.

To update your expense policy, go to your Collective's page, click on the settings button and go to the **Policies** page.

## Examples

### Webpack

> We distribute the money according to the contributions on Github. There is a minimum threshold. You'll receive a mail when you made enough contributions last month.

### Babel

> Feel free to expense a public transport for a conference/meetup as a community member, or for things like stickers. For core members, transport/stay for things like TC39 meetings. For other expenses you can ask. Otherwise, we plan on spending most of the money trying to pay people full time.

## Limit Who Can Submit and Approve Expenses

At the bottom of the Policies Settings screen, you'll see a set of options that allow you to limit who can submit and approve expenses to your collective:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/collectives_settings_expensepolicies_2022-11-23.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Ticking _"Admins cannot approve their own expenses"_ will block admins from approving expenses submitted by themselves, effectively requiring another admin to approve their expenses.
* Ticking "Only allow expenses to be created by Team Members and Financial Contributors (they may invite expenses from other payees)." will limit who can see the "Submit Expense" button.

## Fiscal Host Expense Policy

Your Fiscal Host can also set an [expense policy](../../fiscal-hosts/fiscal-host-settings/#expenses). It will appear on the submit expense page, underneath the Collective policy.

Often times, Collective expense policies are focused on what categories of things are allowed as expenses, while the Fiscal Host policy pertains to required documentation, like details on invoices.
