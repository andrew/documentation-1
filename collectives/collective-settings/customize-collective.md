## Change Logo

To update your logo image, hover over it and click on **Edit logo**, or simply drag an image file onto the logo area.

{% hint style="info" %}
All logos are displayed on a white background, so white logos will not be visible. If you want to use a white logo, upload an image with a colored background instead of a transparent one.
{% endhint %}

## Set Main Color

Your main color determines the color of links and buttons, tier cards, and the hero header if no image is set.

Click on **Edit main color** in the header area to set the color.
