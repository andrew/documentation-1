## Goals

You can define goals to share an overview of your financial plan with your community and to track your progress.

Collective Goals will be sent in the emails sent to your contributors, and you can adjust their visibility on your Collective's settings.

To create your own Collective goals, go to your Collective profile, click on **Settings** and then on **Collective Goals**.

You can choose between three different visual options.&#x20;

**Auto**: Will switch from Logarithm to Linear when 30% of the goal is achieved.&#x20;

**Logarithm**: Will make the progress bar appear larger to incentivise new contributions. This is backed by social proof.&#x20;

**Linear**: Exact visual representation.&#x20;

### How to Create a Goal

To create a goal, give it a **title**, select a **type:**

* **Balance** goals are based on your current balance.

## Tiers

Tiers can be used to provide perks and rewards to supporters, set membership fees, build funding drives (when used with goals), or simply categorise your contributions. \

You can control tiers by accessing the **Tiers** section in your collectives Settings:

## Support Tiers

A great way of having more companies supporting your project is by offering them a support tier, where you offer access to support in exchange for financial contributions. Companies may or may not use it but it gives them the peace of mind to have someone who knows the codebase very available to help them within a reasonable time frame.

An example is [Babel's Base Support Sponsor](https://opencollective.com/babel#contribute) tier.

Here is a template for a basic support tier for your collective:

> Become a Base Support Sponsor with a yearly donation of $24,000 ($2k/month paid in full upfront). Get your logo on our README on Github and on the front page of our website, as well as access to up to 2 hours of support per month. Support will be remote with the option of a share screen or via private chat.

With the above tier example, your responsibilities as a Collective are:

* Adding the sponsor's logo on your website
* Engaging with them to provide the support you've agreed to via the channels specified

The Sponsor's responsibilities are:

* Contacting you via the specified channels&#x20;
* Limiting their support requirements to the time slots specified
* Scheduling the time slots at least a week in advance

## FAQ

### For Collectives

#### How do I define the price?

It depends on a lot of things but mainly on how critical is your open source project to the organization (which is arguably quite subjective). We recommend starting at $500/month with a yearly commitment ($6k upfront) for access to two hours of support a month. As you grow, you can start increasing the price.

#### Why a yearly commitment?

It's easier for companies to budget services for the year. It also ensures that they contribute to the maintenance of the project.

#### What happens if I delete a tier?

If you delete a tier that has recurring contributing members, you will continue to receive contributions from those members. These donations will appear as "custom contributions".&#x20;

Members will need to stop recurring payments from their accounts. Here is more information on how to [cancel a recurring contribution](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments#cancel-a-recurring-contribution).

### For companies

By subscribing to a support tier, you not only get private time for your team to discuss the open-source project that you depend upon, but you are also helping the collective to maintain it. It's a great way to balance your interests with the interests of the community.

#### Do I get an invoice?

Yes, you will receive an invoice emitted by the host of the collective (for example, [Open Source Collective 501c6](https://opencollective.com/opensource)).

#### Can I do a Purchase Order (PO)?

Hosts can work with you to go through your Purchase Order process. Just [reach out to us](https://opencollective.com/help).

#### What if we never were provided with support?

Please [reach out to us](https://opencollective.com/contact) and we will work it out.
