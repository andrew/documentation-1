# Quick Start Guide

## You've got a Collectiveâ€”awesome! Now what?

Once you have a Collective, you can start submitting expenses, edit your page content, and create events for your community right away.&#x20;

In order to receive money or pay out expenses, you need a [Fiscal Host](../fiscal-hosts/fiscal-hosts.md) or you need to be set up as an [independent collective](broken-reference).&#x20;

Whether you have a Fiscal Host yet or not, here are some steps you can take to get your Collective started.

### 1. Make your Collective your own

Update your images and main color and add about info. [Here's how](collective-settings/customize-collective.md).

### 2. Add Core Contributors

If you have collaborators on your project who can help you manage your page and approve expenses add them as Core Contributors. [Here's how](collective-settings/core-contributors.md).&#x20;

### 3. Add Financial Contributors to your GitHub and website

Check the many ways you can export your data on [Data Export](collective-settings/data-export.md) and our diversity of [Buttons & Banners](widgets.md).

### 4. Start tracking expenses

[Submit expenses](../expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses/) through your Collective, so others can see where money will be spent (even if you don't have any yet). This builds trust with potential supporters.

### 5. Spread the word

You can connect your Twitter account to your collective and automatically thank your backers. [Here's how](collective-settings/integrations.md#twitter-integration).

### 6.  Launch!

Write a blog post, tell people the vision, and explain why you are raising money.
