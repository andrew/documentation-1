Interested in working at Open Collective? Check out our [hiring page here](http://opencollective.com/hiring).&#x20;

Every hiring process is different, and non-engineering/product positions often have a significantly different flow, but to get an insight into a past set of hiring processes, read on below.

### **Example Hiring process**&#x20;

_Updated February 9th 2022_

#### **Screening üì∫**&#x20;

_General_

Interested candidates are invited anytime to apply and write us a thoughtful message at any time. Simply dropping a CV is not enough, we want to see an appreciation of what we do and alignment with our values.

Once a week, we will look at current candidates and invite selected ones to the next stage. We, unfortunately, can't invite everyone, so if you don't make it to this stage and are still interested, please wait and contact us again in around \~3 months.&#x20;

_Product_

Additionally, we want to see a history of working in a product capacity, perhaps on platforms like ours.

_Engineering_

To screen candidates, we also want to see a first contribution to our codebase as a PR in one of our GitHub projects. This can be anything but it needs to be mergeable. We suggest sticking to minimal complexity (a few minutes) to simple complexity (a few hours). This can be compensated through our Bounty program, with cash or gift card. If merged but there was no Bounty, we're happy to compensate at similar levels ($200 for simple complexity issues or $40 / hour)

#### **From Screening to Test üëè**&#x20;

To formally meet and answer your questions, we'll schedule a short video call with the hiring manager. We'll assess your fit and try to figure out any blockers. To ensure a fit within the team we‚Äôll schedule another call with one of the colleagues that you‚Äôll be working alongside.

We regularly review new candidates and will invite selected ones to the next stage. We, unfortunately, can't invite everyone, so if you don't make it to this stage and are still interested, please wait and contact us again in around \~3 months.

_Engineering_

To formally meet and answer your questions, we'll schedule a short video call with our CTO. We'll assess your fit and try to figure out any blockers.

#### **Test ‚åõ**&#x20;

For selected candidates, we would like you to complete a medium complexity task that you would typically perform as part of your role (\~4 hours completion time):

You can make reasonable requests for information about our business in order to complete the assignment. You can collaborate with other team members. This will be compensated at the market rate/hour. This will be presented to and reviewed by both the hiring manager and a team member.

This test may be a pairing exercise, a product review, a solution design or some other task depending upon the role you are applying for.&#x20;

**From Test to Trial ü§î**

_Engineering_

You'll have a call again with our CTO, we'll mutually assess if your test was a success. If it does, we'll start scheduling the next stage.

#### **Trial ü§ì**

The final step is an invitation to spend a few days (2 to 5 days) working with the team. Thid will be on some sort of small project, or on various issues, pairing with others, and participating to daily calls. It is similarly compensated.

Concurrently, you will have a video call with one or more members of our leadership team and/or CEO.

**Offer üôåüéä**

Lastly, if the trial is success, we will ask to continue working with you. (Celebrate!)
