## Editing an expense

{% hint style="warning" %}
Making changes to an approved expense means it will need to be approved again before it's paid.

If you have entered incorrect information on your expense you can edit it to fix it. Remember to save your changes. To edit an expense, go to the collectives page and find the expense you want to edit in the **Budget** section.&#x20;
