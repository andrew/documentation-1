# Viewing Transactions

Browse the Open Collective Ledger with the Dashboard Transactions tool. We have designed it to look and operate more similar to a 'bank statement.

To view the Transactions page navigate to your **Dashboard** and then **Transactions**. Utilize the account switcher to switch between accounts.&#x20;

In the transactions table you can see the Date and Time of the transaction, the account, the Recipient/Sender, the Kind of transaction and the Net amount with the Currency.

### **Contextual Transactions**&#x20;

The transactions you see are based on the context in which you are using the tool.

1. If you are individual you will see transactions that are related only to you (expenses you submitted and contributions you made.
2. If you are a collective administrator you will see all the transactions that are related to the collective (all the added funds, contributions made to the collective and expenses submitted to the collective, payment processor and host fees).
3. If you are a fiscal host administrator you will see all of your organizational transactions and all the transactions related to the collectives you host.

### **Related transactions**

Hovering over individual transactions will bring up a blue line to the left. This indicates the groupings of transactions.&#x20;

Multiple transactions occur from the initial transaction for example based off the below screenshot
