# Added Funds in the Ledger

Added funds are funds that are manually added to collective accounts by fiscal hosts when they process manual bank transfers and checks. Added fund related transactions are potentially different from contribution related transactions:

1. They are initiated by a fiscal host admin and not by a contributor.
2. They are created in response to manual data entry (and not automated interaction with a payment processor system).
3. Can be manually dated by the fiscal host admin to reflect when the funds actually arrived. In such cases the “Transaction Date” will show the date (and time) the transaction itself was created in the ledger and and the “Effective date” will show the date entered by the fiscal host admin.

Added funds transaction groups typically look like contributions in the ledger where instead of a pair of CONTRIBUTION transactions there will be a pair of ADDED\_FUNDS transactions.
