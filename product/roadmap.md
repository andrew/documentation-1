# Roadmap

[View our Roadmap updates on our Github](https://github.com/opencollective)

## **Key questions for prioritization**

**This is what we ask ourselves to decide what gets done and what doesn't.**

* Does this serve our mission?
* Will this help to make us financially sustainable within a year?
* Can this make us move faster?
* Does this increase quality?
* Does this add technical debt?
* Is it feasible to build and maintain with our current team and runway?
* What insight or research is this project based on?
* Is this problem already solved elsewhere?
* How will we measure our success? Do we have a baseline today that we can compare this against?
* How well do we understand the complexity of the problem, feature to be added or user needs to be addressed?
* What is the estimated timeframe for delivering this project?

## Template for new projects

* Project owner.&#x20;

    * Delivery&#x20;
    * Q\&A
    * Docs & Comms&#x20;
