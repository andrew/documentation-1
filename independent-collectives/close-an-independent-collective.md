# Close an Independent Collective

{% hint style="danger" %}
With the implementation of the new [Dashboard interface](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/product/understanding-your-dashboard), we are currently in the process of updating our documentation and some pages may be out of date. Thank you for your patience. Please [contact](https://opencollective.com/contact) our support team if you need any assistance.

If you wish to close down your Independent Collective or change to a different Fiscal Host, here are the steps to take.

1. Zero the balance of the Collective, by submitting real expenses to use up the money, or submit an expense for the purpose of zeroing the balance.
2. Go to Settings > Fiscal Host > Reset Fiscal Host
3. From here you can either
   * [Apply to or create a new Fiscal Host](../collectives/add-fiscal-host.md), retaining your Collective's history, database of supporters who receive your Updates, and any recurring contributions, or&#x20;
   * Proceed to [close down your Collective](../collectives/collective-settings/closing-a-collective.md).
